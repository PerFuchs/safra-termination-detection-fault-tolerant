Analyse and discuss data

why does this agree with our hypotheses or not?
  point out and explain anomalies
  
Limitations of my approach
  improvements of my approach
  By FIFO channels plus fault detection via these channels the case that a node crash is detected before its last message was received is not covered
  backup token send event is generated even if the node crashes before
  many backup tokens might be generated because of the locality of my failure detector
  
What do my results imply about Safra?
  
  
  
Comparision to george experiments?

Our setup of an basic algorithm completing its work relatively fast and termination detection taking some time afterwards clearly shows a drawback of fault tolerant Safra.
However, a system with a long running basic algorithm e.g. multiple hours, would put this times in a whole different perspective.
Then the seconds taken to detect termination would be less of an issue and the moderate processing time overhead demostrated far more important.
