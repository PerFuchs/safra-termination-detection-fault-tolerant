why does this agree with our hypotheses or not?
  point out and explain anomalies
  
Limitations of my approach
  improvements of my approach
  By FIFO channels plus fault detection via these channels the case that a node crash is detected before its last message was received is not covered
  backup token send event is generated even if the node crashes before
  
What do my results imply about Safra?
  
Comparision to george experiments?
