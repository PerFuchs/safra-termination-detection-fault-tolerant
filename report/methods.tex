  - Setting:
    - undirected network
    - FIFO channels
    - perfect failure detector "We moreover assume the
    presence of a perfect failure detector at each node, meaning
    that no spurious crash detections can happen and each node
    crash is eventually detected at all other (alive) nodes."
    
  
  - <request> message
    - if a node detects crash of a parent it sends a request messeag to all neigbhours
      - if the neighbour is a child, it sends request messages to all neigbours again
      - else it answers with a dist message which is handled as every other
  
  - Correctness argument
    - crash only interesting if any ancessor fails.
    - by assumption of a perfect failure detector each node will eventually detect
      if it's current parents crash 
    - then it sends request message to all neighbours
      - especially children
        - which then do the same
        - until eventually all nodes in the subtree are reached
      - all none children answer with their dist
        - outside of the subtree perfect, like normal node
        - inside of the subtree (e.g. grandchildren) and is shorter, will be corrected
          when they send out request messages.
            - However, bad for complexity
            
        
  - Further work
    - no FIFO channels
    - Complexity analysis
    - formal proof
    
  - Experimental verification is done by us
  
  - Provide pseudo code
